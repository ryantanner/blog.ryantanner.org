My first trip to Japan was an attempt by my father to get my mind off my long-term girlfriend.  She had just dumped me after four years.  Certainly he was successful but perhaps not thrilled with the means.

I was a junior in college, having a horrible time after returning from a semester in France (which also did not go well).  I had no spring break plans so my father bought me a ticket to Tokyo.  I planned two weeks, hitting the highlights.  Start in Tokyo, take a shinkansen down to Kyoto, do a little temple-hopping, contemplate Americaâ€™s past in Hiroshima and fly home.

I arrived in Tokyo on March 10, 2011.  22 hours later, the fifth-largest earthquake in recorded history struck off the coast of Tohoku.

After the earthquake, the power outages, numerous aftershocks and the
unending cloud of Fukushima, I flew home.

A short trip but one worth at least a few posts:
